/*
 * File: scanadt.h
 * ---------------
 * This file is the interface to a module that exports an abstract
 * data type to facilitate dividing a string into logical units
 * called "tokens," which are either
 *
 * 1. Strings of consecutive letters and digits representing words
 * 2. One-character strings representing punctuation or separators
 *
 * To use this package, you must first create an instance of a
 * scannerADT by calling
 *
 *      scanner = NewScanner();
 *
 * All other calls to the scanner package take this variable as their
 * first argument to identify a particular instance of the abstract
 * scanner type.
 *
 * You initialize the scanner to hold a particular string by calling
 *
 *      SetScannerString(scanner, str);
 *
 * where str is the string from which tokens should be read.  To
 * retrieve each individual token, you make the following call:
 *
 *      token = ReadToken(scanner);
 *
 * To determine whether any tokens remain to be read, you can call
 * the predicate function MoreTokensExist(scanner).  The ReadToken
 * function returns the empty string after the last token is read.
 *
 * The following code fragment serves as an idiom for processing
 * each token in the string inputString:
 *
 *      scanner = NewScanner();
 *      SetScannerString(scanner, inputString);
 *      while (MoreTokensExist(scanner)) {
 *          token = ReadToken(scanner);
 *          . . . process the token . . .
 *      }
 *
 * This version of scanadt.h also supports the following extensions,
 * which are documented later in the interface:
 *
 *   SaveToken
 *   SetScannerSpaceOption
 *   SetScannerStringOption
 *   SetScannerNumberOption

 * Function: NewScanner
 * Usage: scanner = NewScanner();
 * ------------------------------
 * This function creates a new scanner instance.  All other functions
 * in this interface take this scanner value as their first argument
 * so that they can identify what particular instance of the scanner
 * is in use.  This design makes it possible for clients to have more
 * than one scanner process active at the same time.

 * ----------------------------------
 * This function returns the next token from scanner.  If
 * ReadToken is called when no tokens are available, it returns

 * allocated in the heap, which means that clients can call
 * FreeBlock when the token is no longer needed.

 * Functions: SetScannerSpaceOption, GetScannerSpaceOption

 * ignores whitespace characters or treats them as valid tokens.
 * By default, the ReadToken function treats whitespace characters,
 * such as spaces and tabs, just like any other punctuation mark.
 * If, however, you call
 *
 *    SetScannerSpaceOption(scanner, IgnoreSpaces);
 *
 * the scanner will skip over any white space before reading a token.
 * You can restore the original behavior by calling
 *
 *    SetScannerSpaceOption(scanner, PreserveSpaces);
 *
 * The GetScannerSpaceOption function returns the current setting
 * of this option.

/*
 * Functions: SetScannerNumberOption, GetScannerNumberOption
 * Usage: SetScannerNumberOption(scanner, option);
 *        option = GetScannerNumberOption(scanner);
 * ------------------------------------------------
 * This function controls whether the scanner treats numeric values
 * specially.  The default behavior for the scanner is to treat
 * digits as equivalent to letters.  If you call
 *
 *    SetScannerNumberOption(scanner, ScanNumbersAsIntegers);
 *
 * a token beginning with a digit will end at the first nondigit.
 * (Note that digits can still be scanned as part of a token as in
 * the token "x1".)  If you call
 *
 *    SetScannerNumberOption(scanner, ScanNumbersAsReals);
 *
 * the scanner will return the longest token string that represents
 * a real number, if the next character to be scanned is a digit.
 * The format for a real number is a sequence of digit characters
 * that may include at most one decimal point, optionally followed
 * by the letter 'E' in either upper- or lowercase, an optional sign,
 * and an exponent.  You can restore the default behavior by calling
 *
 *    SetScannerNumberOption(scanner, ScanNumbersAsLetters);
 *
 * Even if the number options are enabled, ReadToken always returns
 * its result as a string, which means that you need to call
 * StringToInteger or StringToReal to convert the token to a number.

 * marks in the input.  The default behavior for the scanner is
 * to treat quotes just like any other punctuation character.
 * If, however, you call
 *
 *    SetScannerStringOption(scanner, ScanQuotesAsStrings);
 *
 * a token beginning with a quotation mark will be scanned up to
 * the closing quotation mark.  The quotation marks are returned
 * as part of the scanned token so that clients can differentiate
 * strings from other token types.  The original behavior can be
 * restored by calling
 *
 *    SetScannerStringOption(scanner, ScanQuotesAsPunctuation);
 *
 * When scanning a string, the scanner recognizes the standard
 * escape sequences from ANSI C, such as \n and \t.
